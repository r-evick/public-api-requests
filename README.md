This app will pull 12 random users and their basic information from a Random User Generator URL and display them
on the UI. When a user is clicked a window will popup displaying more of the user's information. When the X id clicked, the window will close, returning to the 12 users.

Extra features:

1. Previous/Next buttons -
    Previous and Next buttons have been added to the popup window, allowing you to easily cycle through
    all 12 users.

2. Search - 
    A search bar has been added to the top of the screen. User's can be searched by typing their first or last name. If no user is found who's name matches, an error message will be displayed.

3. Style - 
    The default background color has been changed to make the page less bland.
